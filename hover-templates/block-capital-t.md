<span style='color:var(--vscode-symbolIcon-methodForeground);'>>T</span> 

Executed at least at <span style='color:var(--vscode-symbolIcon-variableForeground);'>TelePeriod</span> time (SENSOR and STATE) but mostly faster up to every 100 ms  
Only put tele- vars in this section.

Remark: JSON variable names (like all others) may not contain math operators like -  
You should set <span style='color:var(--vscode-symbolIcon-variableForeground);'>SetOption64 1</span> to replace - (dash) with _ (underscore).  
Zigbee sensors will not report to this section, use E instead.
